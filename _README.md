Motivation

A colleague introduced me to the concept of Notakto and Toe Tac Tic.
By rrunning this code, you can play my version of Toe Tac Tic against yourself.

Rules
* the loser is the player who plays the last move
* each board follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules
* on each turn, a player can play on any board they wish, provided it is still in play (see the above rule)

Happy playing...
